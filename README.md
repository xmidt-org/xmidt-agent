## What is Xmidt-Agent?

This is the go replacement for the c client (parodus) running on the RDK-B (internet gateway).  It connects the gateway to the xmidt cloud. 

## Run xmidt-agent simulator as a docker container
1. build xmidt-agent for alpine
    ```cd cmd/xmidt-agent```
    ```env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build .```
2. mv cmd/xmidt-agent/xmdidt-agent binary to the root directory 
3. from the root directory, build the docker container
    ```docker build -t xmdit-agent .```
4. run the container 
    ```docker run xmdit-agent --dev```
5. Note that you will see a connection error unless a websocket server is running at the default url specified by websocket -> back_up_url in cmd/xmidt-agent/default-config.yaml.
6. To override the default configuration, update the below config file OR bind a config file to target "/etc/xmidt-agent/xmidt-agent.yaml" at runtime:
```.release/docker/config/config.yml```
7. If using TLS, the Dockerfile expects the certificate and key files to be ".release/docker/certs" at build time.  Otherwise bind the directory at runtime.
